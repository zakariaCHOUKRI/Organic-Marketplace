# Organic Marketplace

Welcome to the Organic Marketplace project! This is an online platform for buying and selling organic products. Whether you're a producer of handmade soaps, a local farmer with fresh produce, or a small startup offering organic goods like argan products or coffee, this marketplace is designed to help you connect with environmentally conscious buyers in your local area.

## Project Description

The "Organic Marketplace" is a PHP web application that provides a user-friendly interface for both sellers and buyers of organic products. It allows users to create listings for their organic products, search for products by category, location, and keywords, and establish a community of trusted buyers and sellers who are passionate about sustainability and organic living.

### Key Features

- **User Registration and Profiles:** Users can create accounts, provide profile information, and contact details.
- **Product Listings:** Sellers can create, edit, and delete listings with product images, descriptions, prices, and categories.
- **Search and Filter Functionality:** Buyers can search for products and filter results based on their preferences.
- **Authentication and Security:** User authentication is required for secure access to the platform.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Run the PHP Server:**
   To run the application, you need to set up a PHP server and place the `/3rd iteration/application/` folder in the server directory. You can then access the application by navigating to `index.php` in your browser.

   In order to fill the application with data, execute the following SQL files:
   - `/2nd iteration/schema.sql`
   - `/3rd iteration/deliverable/populateDB.sql`
